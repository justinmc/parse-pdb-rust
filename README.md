# parse-pdb - A utility for reading molecular data into Rust
An example of parsing molecular data from [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=file_formats/pdb/index.html) files.

See also the [JavaScript](https://github.com/justinmc/parse-pdb) version that this is based on.

Are you working with PDB files in Rust? Feel free to open an issue or reach out with your use case.  I'm interested in making this a full featured library if there is interest.
